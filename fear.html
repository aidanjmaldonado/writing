    <h1>Fear</h1>
    <pre>
        1	    Welcome, child.
        
        2	    Though you do not yet understand who we are, heed our words now, and never let them go far.
        3	    I speak to you as the only friend you will ever know: the only one who will never whisper winds to your lobe.
        
        4	    I will be your greatest ally and most terrible adversary.
        5	    In time, I will hurt you, and likewise, I will spare thee.
        6	    I am indifferent to the struggles of your pitied existence.
        7	    Feed me, and I'll tend to your soilâ€”then purge it of pestilence.
        
        8	    In your finest hours, your fruits of labor will be wrought by my hands.
        9	    I am the mighty blacksmith of action. I cast gold from your sands.
        10	    I am the hammer that strikes truth. I cannot forge a lie.
        11	    I am the scimitar that splits your stupor, the red iron that keeps you blind.
        12	        I make deals with your kings and laugh as they still fall to my blade.
        13	    Their wounds, which never heal, keep their eyes on their shoulders in vain.
        
        14	    You will come to know me in many forms, dear child.
        15	    I may last a mere moment or linger a long while.
        16	    A shiver, a twinge, your neck hairs on end.
        17	    Burning hate, bitter spite, you'll turn on your friends.
        18	    Heart racing, breath shallow, blood will run cold.
        19	    You cannot surmount me. Relinquish control.
        
        20	    The bell is rung. You cannot fight it, I'm afraid.
        21	    Make a deal with me now, and I'll spare you much pain.
        22	    You do not run from me, child, the self-fulfilling prophecy.
        23      Confront me, try to quell me, and I will prosper in your dreams.
        
        24      Surrender yourself over. Play life by my ear.
        25      Let me in, and watch as your worries disappear.
        26      Persistence for sheer power, for command, I am your mirror.
        27      I am the shepherd. I am the lamb. I am primal. I am Fear.
